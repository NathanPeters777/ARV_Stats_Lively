## Warning! This is currently pre-Alpha software

ARV Stats is being created to give Remote Viewers and Project Managers who practice ARV an accessible and easy to use online program for project creation, management and participation.

Things are quite basic currently. Eventually I am planning to add e-mail notifications and live charting in D3.js.

Available fields are in-flux, looking for recommendations of the best things to track in this online system.

### General system operation/flow

<ol>
<li>The site is invite-only. Users cannot create their own accounts without initial action from an admin.</li>
<li>Although people cannot create their own accounts, site data can be viewed publically without having to log in.</li>
<li>For a user to become a Project Manager and create/manange their own groups, and admin has to set their account as a Project Mananger.</li>
<li>A Project Manager can create their own groups and can add targets to these groups.</li>
<li>A Project Manager can add other site users to the membership list for their groups.</li>
<li>Users who have been added to a Group can add Trial (or session) data to tagets within that group. A Project Manager who wants to include their own Trial data has to also explicitly add themselves to the group membership.</li>
</ol>
